# TrafficSignalControl

In this project, we aim to implementing a learning algorithm that will allow traffic control devices to study traffic patterns/behaviors for a given intersection and
optimize traffic flow by altering stoplight timing. With the help of Q-Learning technique, where an agent, based on the given state, selects an appropriate action for the intersection in order to maximize present and future rewards.
